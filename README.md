# scrh
Scratch does not offer short links, meaning you don't have to waste space in your GitHub.
Well, this project shortens those long links.

This project is developed by the HackerCat project, aiming to make Scratch better.

## Disclaimer
This project is not affiliated with the Scratch Foundation or the MIT Media Lab.
Use it at your own risk.

## Domain Name Volunteers
The HackerCat project needs **domain names** for the scrh project to make links much shorter.
For now, we have made this project part of a separate GitHub profile.
When possible please provide any scrh domain names you have registered for the project.
The scrh project will not take ownership of the domain names, you have the rights to the domain
and we will use it while you renew it.

By doing this you will become a member of the HackerCat project.
